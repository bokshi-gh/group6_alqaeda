1. Write a Java program using a for loop and if statement to print all numbers between 1 and 50 that are divisible by either 3 or 5, but not both.

2. Write a Java program that takes a number from the user and prints all numbers from 1 to that number, but skips printing multiples of 4 using an if condition inside a for loop.

3. Write a Java program using a for loop and if statements to print “Fizz” for numbers divisible by 3, “Buzz” for numbers divisible by 5, and “FizzBuzz” for numbers divisible by both, between 1 and 30.

4. Write a Java program that asks for 10 integers and prints only those that are even and greater than 20 using if and for loops.

5. Write a Java program that prints the sum of even numbers and the product of odd numbers between 1 and 10 using a for loop and if condition.

6. Write a Java program using a for loop that prints numbers from 1 to 30, but:
Prints “skip” instead of 15,
Doubles any number divisible by 4 before printing,
And prints “done” at the end.

7. Write a Java program that simulates an ATM PIN verification system.
The program should have a correct PIN stored (for example, 1234) and allow the user up to three attempts to enter the correct PIN.
If the user enters the correct PIN, print "Access Granted" and stop the program.
If the user enters the wrong PIN, print "Incorrect PIN, try again".
After three incorrect attempts, print "Account locked".
